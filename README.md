# blendartrack

With the mobile app blendartrack you can easily track you enviroment. Just move your device slowly, place some reference objects and you are ready to track. You can also track your face to get an animated geometry. The tracking data gets stored locally on the device and can be exported as .JSONs in a .zip. There is no personal data nor cloud required. To import the data in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) you can use the [Blender Add-On blendartrack](https://github.com/cgtinker/blendartrack).

The exported data may be used in any Software, however please let me know before considering to publish third party software.

# Development

## General
**Tracking:**
Retargeter makes use of ArFoundation to access the Subsytems ArCore and ArKit. The tracking data is mainly gatherd from the subsystem and gets written to .JSON Files during the tracking process. The serialization process requires some manual .JSON-Syntax adjustments. Good timing is required to archive decent tracking result, the build includes interfaces to make this process rather easy.

**Viewer:**
The Viewer could still be improved and is currently fairly basic. The .JSON data basically gets projected on some reference objects.

**Design:**
Design may not be used reused in third party software.

**Video Recording:**
Currently a commercial addon is used to record the camera background. If happen to know or develop an open source YUV 420 recorder for iOS & Android I'd love to implement it.
