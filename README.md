# ArRetargeter

This app saves the ar pose estimated data of the camera pose / face into a .json file. The .json can be imported into 
blender to retrive the camera motion / android face mesh / ios shape keys.


The app currently includes two plugins by: Süleyman Yasir KULA, yasirkula.

Currently the app is in development. You can download and build the app, the received .json can be used in any way, even commercially. However you currently aren't allowed to modify or sell the app.
